> Two days ago the police came to me and wanted me to stop working on this. Today they asked me to delete all the code from GitHub. I have no choice but to obey.

> I hope one day I'll live in a country where I have freedom to write any code I like without fearing.

> I believe you guys will make great stuff with Network Extensions.
